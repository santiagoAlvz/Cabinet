# Cabinet

Cabinet is a Python script for automatically sorting a collection of pictures into categories using their date and location. When provided an origin and destination folder, Cabinet will read the metadata from all pictures in the folder, and copy the picture into the right subfolder in the destination, according to its year, country and town/county/city of taking.
